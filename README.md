# Honeypot
Creating a honeypot using TPot in a GCP compute instance. Goals of this project is to discover malicious traffic to my instance and visualize it to garner insights.

First I created a new GCP project labelled TPot and created a new e2-standard-2 VM instance on the Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye) distro with a 128 GB disk named tpot-a.
